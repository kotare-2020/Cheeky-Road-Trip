# $how, Don't Tell

# Kahu 2018 Cohort Group Project

Meetings are expensive, but sometimes we forget how expensive they are and feel the need to talk for too long about topics that are unimportant for the meeting purpose.

This is an app to display the costs of meetings, and track the costs of your meetings over time.

The idea of the App is to be able to display the real-time cost of a meeting as it occurs.
This cost is calculated based on the hourly wages of the meeting's attendees and the current duration of the meeting.

The intended effect of this App is to make meeting attendees aware of how much this time is costing the business.


## User Stories

### MVP

As a user:
  * I want to register for the App under my name, and state my hourly wage
  * I want to start a new meeting, and add all the meeting members. (MVP: Add member names and wages manually)
  * I want to start my created meeting, and see a ($) cost tracker display the current meeting cost every second
  * I want to be able to save a meeting's cost, attendess, duration and date/time when it is finished for later viewing
  * I want to be able to view previous meetings in date/time order, and see more information about a past meeting.
  * I want to see a graph of meeting costs over time

### Stretch
  * I want to be able to select existing users of the App as meeting attendees, so that our wages don't have to be shown / inputted manually. If a meeting attendee doesn't have an account, I want to be able to manually add them to the App.
  * I want to be able to state my yearly salary rather than hourly rate as an option on register
  * I want to be able to view all meetings that I am an attenee for, and I want information about my meetings to not be visible to all users of the app.
  * I want to create a group of regular attendees for my meeting group to make setting up my meeting easier.


## Setup

Run the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
npm install (or yarn install)
knex migrate:latest
knex seed:run

```

  `npm run dev` || `yarn dev` for bundling, watch and nodemon

  `npm start` only runs server (setup for heroku)


## Heroku!!!

### Creating your app

Create your app with `heroku create [name]`

You can check that this was successful by running `heroku apps` to view a list of your apps


### Adding postgres

Add postgresql (hobby dev) to your app at `https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/[APP NAME HERE]/resources`

Check that pg has been added by running `heroku addons` to ensure the postgresql db is on your app


### Deploying!

I have created several npm scripts that will be useful for deploying your app to heroku easily.

`npm run h:deploy` will push your local master branch to your heroku app

`npm run h:migrate` will run your knex migrations on your deployed heroku app

`npm run h:seed` will run your seeds on your deployed app

If ever you need to rollback, you can also just use `npm run h:rollback`


### Ta-Da!
Your app should be deployed!
