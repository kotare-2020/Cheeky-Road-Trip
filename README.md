## User Stories
### MVP
* ~~I want to be able to establish my road trip with a title, and start/end waypoints~~
* ~~I want to see a map that shows me the route between my waypoints~~
* I want to see all the public bathrooms near my route*
* ~~I want to see direction instructions~~

### Stretch

## New Tech

* Leaflet and React-Leaflet
Node modules used to set up the map interface and the markers using react components. (no longer being used)

* Leaflet Routing Machine
Creates the route between our established waypoints. (no longer being used)

* Mapbox.gl
Swapped from leaflet to mapbox due to issues we were having with leaflet's routing machine

* Position Stack API
Used to convert street addresses into GPS coordinates for our user start/end point input.
